    "\n",
    "The *raw_contour* is a list of points that are not ordered in any way both belonging to the base line of the tool and belonging to the teeth profile, so the first step is to separate them. The separation is done by studying the points which have a x coordinate equal to 0, among these points the ones that have the highest y coordinate are the ones belonging to the base line of the tool, the others are the ones belonging to the teeth profile. Once the first points belonging to the base line have been found, it's easy to find all the other points belonging to the base line of the tool by looking for the points that have a y coordinate in a neighborhood of the first points. The idea behind this is that the base line is similar to a straight line. Thus, two lists of points are created, one for the base line and one for the teeth profile. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is to order the points belonging to the teeth profile in a way that makes sense. The order of the points is important for the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm to work properly. The points are therefore ordered according to the euclidean distance which allows to find the nearest neighbors of a point which are the next points in the contour. In order to speed up the process, the euclidean distance is not computed for all the points in the teeth profile list but just for the ones that are close enough, it has been empirically proven that a neighborhood dimension of 120 pixels is perfect, to the point which is being studied. \n",

It returns a list of lists of points, each list of points is a segment of the teeth profile. The function works by finding the points that are close enough, distance point to point below a certain threshold, to each other. The points, that are close enough, are then grouped together in a list, close_points. If the number of points in close_points is greater than the minimum number of points, , and the parabola that fits them has an \"a\" coefficient lesser then 0, it means that the parabola opens downwards which is a common characteristic of all the circular arcs in the tool's blade, then the points are considered to be a circular arc and the group is added to the list of segments. If this is not the case, the points do not belong to a circular arc, so just the point which is being studied is added to the list of segments.\n",

The function separates the x and y coordinates of the points into separate arrays, x and y. It then constructs a matrix A where each row corresponds to a point and each column corresponds to a term in the equation of a parabola (y = ax^2 + bx + c). Then by calling calls np.linalg.lstsq, which solves the equation A*coeffs = y in a least squares sense, it finds the coefficients a, b, and c that minimize the sum of the squared residuals. \n",

In other words, the function works by finding the points, in *sorted_contour*, that are not circular arcs and adding them to the *straight_lines* list which will be returned."

The function works by computing the lines that best fit the two sides of the tooth and then by finding the intersection of the two lines, the vertex. It returns the two lines and their intersection.

The function works by computing the angle between the two lines that best fit the two sides of the tooth. A tooth is considered to be a fine if the angle is greater than 37 degrees and lesser than 42.5 degrees, otherwise it is considered to be defective.

The function takes as input the list of points belonging to the side of a tooth and the ideal profile, which is a line that starts at the vertex of the triangle that fit the tooth and ends either at the first or the last (depending on which side is being analyzed) point of the side, of the tooth. It returns the deviation of the side from the ideal profile. The function works by finding the point in the side that is the farthest from the ideal profile using the *DPTL* function.
